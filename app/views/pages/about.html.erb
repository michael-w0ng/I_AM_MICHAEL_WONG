      <p>Hi! I’m Michael 👋 - a Junior Fullstack Developer 💻, Silversmith 🔨, and Educator 👨‍🏫</p>

      <p>
        Originally from the land of beaches (Sydney 🏖), I studied in the coffee, culture, & cricket Capital (Melbourne 🏏) before moving to the ‘Second City’ (Birmingham 🏭).  Eventually I ended up in the Big Smoke (London 💷) but couldn’t resist a sojourn to the ‘Melbourne of the North’ (Berlin 🕺).
      </p>

      <p>I am a trained Jeweller and Silversmith, exhibiting widely across Australia and the UK.</p>

      <p>I have extensive experience in education, having worked in multiple education institutions around the world.</p>

      <p>I love making and I’m not picky about the medium.  From physical objects, to web apps, or even dinner, it’s the act of creation that engages me.</p>

      <p>Constantly looking for ways to combine making and education.</p>
